This is my first project i pushed into GitHub. :)

The files that contain the code are Program.cs, Library.cs and Book.cs.

I got this idea from chatgpt (surprise surprise) by writing "give me a coding task in c# language that would be presented to a person who is being intervied for a junior developer role". :D Impressive right?
This is the start of my coding journey (atleast publicly).

So into the code, the program is simply, it consist of three cs files and one json.

The program manages a library, where you can add, search,
view and delete books. Also When the program is started it loads the books that were previously added and when the program is ended it saves the books that were added during the session.
Using Newtonsof.Json SerializeObject and DeserializeObject methods.
